Configuration files:

- core.json5: Configuration unrelated to policies, such as custom datasources and custom managers.
- team-devops.json5: Auto-remediation strategy configuration file for the devops team.
- base.json: Legacy configuration file that fully inherits devops.json5, kept for compatibility.
